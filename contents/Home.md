# Ray Optics Simulation

<p class="lead">
A small fun/school project to simulate the reflection of a light ray in two-dimensional space. Easily expandable to support more shapes and materials. 
</p>

Currently, the simulation supports entities such as circles, lines, and (approximated) curves, each consisting of one material, there is one material at the moment, but an extension is easily possible.

The project is written in Typescript and visualized with [pts.js](https://ptsjs.org) in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

## Intro

The physical principles of the reflection of light rays follow a simple logic.
The paths of reflected light waves can be predicted almost intuitively
can be predicted almost intuitively from simple geometric shapes. In
a more complex environment with an increased number of physically
relevant entities, the prediction of the totality of all effects on the
effects on the light path will be increasingly difficult for humans to predict and,
above all, time-consuming. If even the initial effort for the digital implementation of these
physical optical fundamentals of reflection may be greater, this is
especially in mentioned more extensive situations, this is practicable and
and allows fast iterations concerning the change of the result
in connection with the initial situation.
